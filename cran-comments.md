This is a re-submission of an archived package. I have updated the code to work with the latest version of "dplyr" and removed the dependencey on the "mbgraphic" package from the example. However, "mbgraphic", which is not currently available on CRAN, is still suggested as it can provide valuable additional functionality.

## Test environments
